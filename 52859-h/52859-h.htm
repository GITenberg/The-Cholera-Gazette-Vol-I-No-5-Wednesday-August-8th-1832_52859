<h2><i>M. Petit’s Treatment of Cholera.</i></h2>

<p>The principal indication which M. Petit, one of the physicians of
the Hôtel-Dieu de Paris, proposes to himself to fulfil, in the treatment
of cholera, is to keep up a constant impression upon the
spinal marrow, and to change the phenomena of innervation. To
effect this he places over the whole length of the spine a strip
of flannel, wet with a liniment composed of an ounce of the essence
of turpentine and a drachm of aqua ammonia, and passes
slowly over it a very hot flat-iron. An instantaneous evaporation of
a great part of the liniment results, which acts powerfully on the
skin over the spine, and induces very speedily vesication. The heat
returns to the skin, the cramps and vomitings disappear, the circulation
is reëstablished, and the patient feels much better. The effects
of this remedy are assisted by hot bricks to the limbs; by frictions to
the body with a decoction of mustard, to which some aq. ammonia
is added, and the patient is also made to drink copiously of balm
and mint tea. A table-spoonful of the following potion is likewise
given every hour:&mdash;℞. Aq. distil. Tilleæ Europeæ; aq. distil. melissæ,
āā. ℥ij.; tinct. opii, gtt. xx.; syrup. ether. ℥j. M. Finally,
the patient is rubbed all over with a liniment composed of camphorated
oil of chamomile, ℥ij.; laudanum, ℨij.; liquid ammonia, ℨj.</p>

<p>M. Petit is said to have been more successful than most of his colleagues
in the treatment of cholera. In a communication to the Academy
of Medicine he states that under the above treatment two-thirds
of his patients have recovered.</p>

<h2><i>On Density of Population.</i></h2>

<p>Density of population in cities becomes a matter of extreme importance
connected with the visitations of pestilential diseases. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
too crowded population may of itself engender a pestilence, and
must inevitably aggravate one should it prevail from other causes.
Hence the necessity which occasionally arises of thinning the inhabitants
of certain districts&mdash;an exigency which, like that of war, often
subverts civil authority, and demands the exercise of the most arbitrary
power. We have recently seen our New York neighbours compelled
to thin the population in some parts of their city, and we may
yet be forced to have recourse to a similar measure. Upon this subject
there are some interesting calculations furnished in Hazzard’s
Register, (Vol. VIII. No. 5,) where may be found an interesting table,
exhibiting the number of square feet in each ward of our city,
together with the population at each census from 1790 to 1830, and
the number of square feet to each inhabitant. From this table it appears
that the increase in density of population throughout the city
plot, has been in the following proportion during the forty years embraced
in the estimate.</p>

<table summary="Population density">
  <tr>
    <td>In</td><td>1790</td><td>there was</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td>person to</td><td class="tdr">1755</td><td>square feet.</td>

    <td></td><td>1830</td><td class="tdc">”</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td class="tdc">”</td><td class="tdr">623</td><td></td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Viewing the wards separately, we find that, in 1830, there was
one inhabitant to every 313 square feet of superficies in the eastern
division, and one to 979 of the western.</p>

<table summary="Population density by ward">
  <tr>
    <td>Eastern Wards.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>New Market ward had</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td>to</td><td class="tdr">236</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Lower Delaware</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td></td><td class="tdr">243</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Upper Delaware</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td></td><td class="tdr">318</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Chesnut</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td></td><td class="tdr">341</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Walnut</td><td class="tdr">1</td><td></td><td class="tdr">398</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td class="tdr">Average</td><td></td><td></td><td class="tdtotal">313</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>In the western wards, where there is a large proportion of unoccupied
ground, the density varies from 840 to 1354 square feet to each
inhabitant&mdash;the average being 979.</p>

<p>The propriety of legislative enactments limiting the maximum density
of population, and the space allowed to be occupied by buildings,
so as to ensure sufficient ventilation, &amp;c. seems to us to be manifest.
We shall take a future opportunity of offering some further remarks
on this subject.</p>

<h2><i>Injection of Saline Solutions into the Veins.</i></h2>

<h3>No. 4.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Letter from Dr. Lewins, to the Secretary of the Central Board of Health.</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Results of the Injection Practice in the Drummond-street Cholera Hospital,
Edinburgh.</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,&mdash;You will receive from Dr. Latta, the details of two or three cases
treated by saline injections. We have both been so much occupied to-day, that
we have not had leisure to get our communications ready to be sent in the
same envelope. We steal an hour from the time usually allotted for rest to
write to you. In case Dr. Latta should omit to mention the circumstance, I beg
to mention that his patient, Cousins, the woman who was injected to the amount
of three hundred and seventy-six ounces, and who promised to do well, for a
considerable time, was a person of very dissipated habits.</p>

<p>In the Drummond-street hospital six patients have been injected, and three
recovered, or are recovering. In the three that died, extensive organic disease
was found on dissection; disease that had existed previously to the attack of
cholera.</p>

<p>I send herewith the report of two cases, treated by Dr. Craigie of this place,
which, at my request, he furnished me to-day for the perusal of the Board.</p>

<p>I intended to have sent an account of an interesting fatal case, the only one
in which the venous injection may be said to have fairly failed where it was
fairly used; that I shall do to-morrow.</p>

<p class="center">I have the honour to be, sir, your most obedient servant.</p>

<p class="right">ROBERT LEWINS, M. D.</p>

<p><i>Leith, May 27th.</i></p>

<h3>No. 5.</h3>

<p class="center"><i>Details of Two Cases of Malignant Cholera treated by Venous Injection, by Dr.
Craigie, of Leith.</i></p>

<p><i>No. 1. Case successful. 15lbs. injected at intervals in nine hours.</i>&mdash;Martha
Smith, aged thirty-eight, a noted drunkard, thin and debilitated, in sixth month
of pregnancy, admitted into the hospital at 8 P. M. May 16th, 1832.</p>

<p>It appears she had had vomiting and purging since Sunday morning, 12th
inst. Cramps came on about four hours ago in both legs; great evacuations
both upwards and downwards like dirty water. The countenance is now collapsed;
eyes sunk; tongue cold; pulse imperceptible at wrists; very small in
brachial artery; 124.</p>

<p>℞. Muriat sodæ, ℨiij; Carbon sodæ, ℨi; Aq. calid. ℔vj. solve. Ft. Enema
statim injiciend. Sinapisms to spine and epigastrium; let her be placed on
heated tin mattress.</p>

<p>Nine A. M. Has a good deal of vomiting; is getting warmer; pulse now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
perceptible in right wrist; tongue warmer; she allows the enema to come away
without giving notice to nurse. Saline enema as above, with the addition of
white of eggs, to be repeated every half hour.</p>

<p>Ten. Vomiting and purging of watery fluid, with slimy matter in it.</p>

<p>Half-past ten. Cramps have returned severe in left leg; pulse again imperceptible;
urgent thirst, and constant vomiting. <i>Rep. enema et pulveres effervescentes.</i></p>

<p>Half-past eleven. Breathing becoming much affected; extreme restlessness;
cramps severe in legs, and every symptom of sinking. Let the following saline
solution be injected into one of the veins of the arm.</p>

<p>℞. Muriat sodæ, ℨi; Carbon sodæ, gr. x; Aq. calid. ℔iij, solve temp. 105°
Fahr.</p>

<p>Noon. When about ℔i. had been thrown in, the pulse was perceived to flutter
at the wrist, and gradually strengthened as the injection was proceeded
with. By the same ℔iiiss. had been injected, the countenance, which was before
quite death-like, now beamed with the appearance of health, and she began
to converse freely. Pulse 96, moderate. To have ℥i. gin in warm water
with sugar.</p>

<p>Half-past one. The gin was immediately rejected. Pulse has again gradually
become imperceptible, and respiration quick and laborious.</p>

<p>Two. Let the venous injection be repeated to ℔vij.</p>

<p>The effect of the injection, as formerly, was very striking. To see an individual
who seemed <i>in articulo mortis</i> brought back, as it were, in so short a
space of time to an apparently tolerable state of health, could not but astonish
the beholder. Before the injection was finished the pulse had returned to a
healthy fulness and firmness. Expresses herself much relieved; no purging,
but vomits much serous matter.</p>

<p>℞. Muriat sodæ, ℨij; Carbon sodæ, ℨi; Alcohol. dilut. ℥i; Aq. calid. ℔iij.
M. ft. enema statim injiciend.</p>

<p>Four. Enema retained about an hour and a half; surface of body now comfortably
warm; she has not passed more fluid by stool than was thrown into the
rectum.</p>

<p>Six. Has slept softly for an hour; the first sleep she has had for many days.</p>

<p>℞. Subm. hydrarg. gr. v; Pulv. opii, gr. ss. M. sumat stat. et rep. 3tia quaque
hora.</p>

<p>Nine. Complains much of vomiting and sense of weakness; countenance
rather collapsed; breathing rather difficult.</p>

<p>Let ℥lxxx. be injected into the veins again gradually.</p>

<p>After the first few ounces were thrown in she complained of an acute pain
at the epigastrium, and faintness, probably arising from the fluid being thrown
in too fast upon the heart, or from the passing of a bubble or two of air, which
may have got in from the inaccuracy of the injecting apparatus used. Be that
as it may, the circulating system was so much affected, that the pulse, from
being distinct though feeble, became quite imperceptible, but on stopping the
injection for a few minutes the pulse gradually returned, and the pain abated.
She expresses herself as always getting relief from the operation.</p>

<p>Eleven. Vomiting continues urgent.</p>

<p>App. emp. cantharid. epigast. Effervescing draughts occasionally.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>May 17th. Has passed about ℔j. of urine, of natural appearance; this is the
first she has made since she was brought in.</p>

<p>From this time she went on gradually to improve, but stomach continued very
irritable, and the matter vomited was bilious.</p>

<p>21st. Labour pains came on, and she was delivered of a still-born female
child.</p>

<p>22d. Symptoms of phlebitis in right arm came on, proceeding from the
wound upwards, but this yielded to the ordinary treatment, and she may now
be considered out of all danger, though she is not yet reported cured.</p>

<hr class="r15" />

<p><i>No. 2. Case fatal&mdash;appearances on dissection.</i>&mdash;George Cousins, aged ten, was
brought into quarantine at nine, A. M. 13th May, on account of his mother being
ill of cholera. About an hour after admission began to vomit and purge, and
it appears he has had diarrhœa severely all the morning. Pulse 102, extremely
weak; complains much of sickness; countenance collapsed; areolæ rather dark
under the eyes; voice very weak.</p>

<p>He had hot air-bath immediately, and got the following dose:&mdash;</p>

<p>℞. Ol. ricini, ℥ss; Tinct. opii, gtt. xv; Aq. menth. pip. ℥iss. M. ft. haust.</p>

<p>Half-past eleven, A. M. Draught retained; sickness has gone off; complains
of heat of bath; let it be removed.</p>

<p>Noon. Has vomited some watery matter, with undigested potatoes in it, and
again a rice-watery fluid with flocculi. He has now a considerable degree of
jactitation; countenance more sunk, and great desire for cold water. These
symptoms went on increasing in severity in spite of sinapisms to spine, effervescing
draughts, calomel, and Dover’s powder, warm water, enemeta, &amp;c., and
head symptoms were now making their appearance.</p>

<p>Half-past two P. M. Pulse quite imperceptible, and has been so for an hour
and a half; he lies quiet and drowsy, with eyes turned upwards; face bedewed
with cold perspiration; hands and feet cold and very blue.</p>

<p>My colleagues, Drs. Combe and Lewins, saw him with me at this time, and
concurred with me in thinking him not only beyond all hope of recovery, but
likely to die <i>within an hour or two</i>.</p>

<p>From what I had seen of the resuscitating powers of Dr. Latta’s treatment
on the boy’s mother this morning, by venous injection, I determined on giving
it a trial, though this was a case rather likely to bring discredit on the remedy
than otherwise. The following solution, at temperature 102° F. was slowly
injected into the median basilic by means of a common silver blow-pipe attached
to Reid’s enema syringe:&mdash;</p>

<p>℞. Muriat sodæ, ℨi; Carbon sodæ, gr. x; Aq. calid. ℔vj. solve. T. 102.</p>

<p>Three P. M. A few minutes after the injection was commenced the pulse
returned to the wrists, the blueness and coldness of the extremities gradually
wore off; the countenance was much improved; and the whole fluid was injected
within twenty minutes.</p>

<p>Half-past three P. M. He has now a healthy, blooming appearance; is sitting
up in bed, and looking about him as if awoke out of a dream. Pulse 110, natural;
extremities of good colour and warm; voice much stronger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span></p>

<p>Half-past four P. M. Pulse has been gradually falling off since last report;
is getting listless, and dislikes to be troubled with questions, breathing becoming
laborious, and head symptoms more marked, with squinting to a slight degree
superadded.</p>

<p>Seven P. M. Pulse again imperceptible; respiration quick and laboured;
countenance collapsed; tongue and breath cold; says he is dying.</p>

<p>Let the venous injection be repeated to ℔iij.</p>

<p>Half-past seven P. M. Pulse immediately returned, of natural strength and
fulness, and continues so.</p>

<p>Nine P. M. Lies very quiet; pulse good; breathing more natural; surface of
body covered with warm perspiration.</p>

<p>Ten P. M. Large watery evacuations from the bowels came on soon after
last injection; the quantity cannot easily be guessed, but must have been considerable,
as it is running through the mattress on the floor. Pulse scarcely
perceptible; screams loudly like a child in hydrocephalus.</p>

<p>Eleven P. M. Pulse quite imperceptible; is sinking fast; venous injections
attempted a third time, but desisted from as it was not productive of the first
good effects. Both pupils much dilated. Died at two A. M. 14th.</p>

<p><i>Dissection fifteen hours after death.</i>&mdash;On exposing the brain and spinal marrow,
but before opening their investing membranes, the least pressure with the fingers
on the middle of the hemispheres of the brain caused a remarkable undulating
down to the middle of the back, showing the existence of a fluid beneath
the membranes, and on opening them about two drachms of pure serum flowed
out.</p>

<p>The surface of the brain was rather vascular, and the blood in the most minute
vessels particularly bright. A few ecchymosed spots on its surface. All
the other viscera were found healthy. The urinary bladder contained about
half an ounce of urine.</p>

<p>10. Please to give the details of two or three cases treated by saline injections,
with age, condition of life, temperament, habits, &amp;c., and particulars of
such other treatment as may have been adopted in addition to the saline injections.</p>

<p class="center">ANSWERS BY DR. LEWINS.</p>

<p>1. None before. One to the amount of twelve ounces immediately after the
first injection.</p>

<p>2. The evacuations by purging and vomiting, in most of the cases continued.
In some of them the purging, the discharge from the bowels at least, was increased.
Perspiration was increased in all.</p>

<p>3. Yes; no less than ten of the fifteen that have been injected up to the present
day; but under such circumstances as do not detract from the general
merits of the practice: this will be made evident by the history of the cases
that will be sent by to-morrow’s post.</p>

<p>4. Yes; even at the axilla in some of the cases, blueness of the surface had
taken place to a considerable extent. Five of these patients recovered.</p>

<p>5. Complete suppression, I think, in all except two, and for hours. In all
the successful, and in some of the unsuccessful cases, the effects of the injection
in restoring the secretion of urine were most evident.</p>

<p>6. The injections raised the temperature of the body; but in all the successful
cases, where the veins were injected, the patients complained of cold soon
after the injection.</p>

<p>7. Neither the blood nor the evacuations were analysed, but I sent some of
the blood of a patient that had been injected by the veins, to Dr. Reed for
analysis to-day.</p>

<p>8. The consecutive fever in all the patients who were injected, has been
slight.</p>

communicating more to you to-night than the following brief particulars of a
case that occurred at the Leith Cholera Hospital yesterday:&mdash;</p>

<p>A woman of about forty years of age, was admitted on Sunday evening at
7 o’clock. She was <i>pulseless</i>, even at the axilla, <i>sightlesss</i>, <i>cold</i>, and <i>blue</i>, over
almost the whole body. <i>Respiration</i> very slow and irregular&mdash;in a word, she
was all but lifeless. It was feared she would be dead before the operation of
injecting could be commenced. Between 7 at night and 2 o’clock next morning,
there were thrown in two hundred and eighty-four ounces, upwards of
twenty-three pounds. The report of her situation at 2 on Monday morning, in
the hospital book, is as follows:&mdash;“A change for the better, that appears almost
miraculous, has taken place. The action of the heart is greatly improved;
respiration not in the least laborious, but quicker than natural; pulse 120, small,
but distinct. She can articulate distinctly; countenance natural; lips red; tongue
moist and warm; she perspires freely; heat over the whole body natural.”</p>

<p>A full report of this wonderful case shall be forwarded soon.</p>

Dr. Alison had seen the patient eight hours before the operation, and
the pulse was then imperceptible.</p>

<h2><i>Origin of the Cholera at Quebec.</i></h2>

<p class="right"><i>Board of Health, Quebec, June 25th, 1832.</i></p>

<p>The undersigned, appointed by the Board of Health to investigate and report
upon the introduction and treatment of the cholera, now existing in this country,
have agreed to the following Report, which they respectfully submit.</p>

<p>The disease, on its first appearance in this city, exhibited all the characters of
that commonly called the Asiatic or Spasmodic Cholera. It commenced about the
8th instant, in boarding houses and taverns in the Cul-de-Sac&mdash;a low, uncleanly,
and ill-ventilated part of the city&mdash;crowded with emigrants of the lowest description,
with sailors and other persons of irregular habits.</p>

<p>About the fourth day of the disease, (the 12th,) it showed itself in the more
elevated parts of the city, among the wealthier classes of society, and persons
of sober and regular habits, who could have had but little, if any, direct communication
with the people among whom the disease had first appeared.</p>

<p>About the same date, (the 12th,) the disease was observed in various parts
of the city, and in several neighbouring parishes, some few miles distant, having
a constant intercourse with it.</p>

<p>The cases continued to increase in number until about the 16th or 18th,
(being the 8th or 10th day of the disease,) when they began to subside, both
in number and in violence&mdash;the disease still prevailing more extensively in the
ill-ventilated parts of the city above mentioned. About the period of its greatest
prevalence, (the 8th or 10th day of the disease,) the number of cases was
estimated to be between 250 and 300, in the course of twenty-four hours.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span></p>

<p>The undersigned have not as yet been able to discover that any case of cholera
has been landed from any vessel in the harbour, before nor until several
days after its first appearance in the city.</p>

<p>They deem it necessary to add, that some parishes in the neighbourhood of
Quebec have continued free from the disease until lately, and that no case appears
to have yet occurred at Three Rivers, an intermediate and populous town
between Montreal and Quebec, where the steamboats with emigrants from
Quebec, generally arrive.</p>

<p>Since the appearance of this malady, only two soldiers have been attacked
in Quebec, and those while on duty&mdash;the rest being closely confined to their
quarters.</p>

<p>The symptoms were the most violent at the commencement, and continued
so until about the 16th or 18th, when they began to mitigate in severity, as the
cases diminished in number.</p>

<p>In the treatment of this disease, recourse has been had to almost every remedy
favourably reported of by European practitioners, and they all have had,
for a time, their advocates&mdash;some preferring stimulants, others opiates, while
others satisfied themselves with an intermediate plan of treatment&mdash;the whole
of the medical practitioners with one accord agreeing, however, in the application
of external stimulants, such as oil of turpentine, mustard, warm applications
and frictions; calomel and opium have been much relied on by many.
Practitioners speak with confidence of blood-letting at the onset of the disease,
and before an approach to collapse has been recognised. Sweating has been
much practised, and decidedly with advantage, when it is not allowed to run
into that state of collapse indicated by a pulseless wrist, dejected countenance,
blue extremities, tongue and breath cold, and a sunken voice, feeling as if it
passed through the ears.</p>

<p>Some instances have been noticed, and also observed by our intelligent
clergy, as well as by ourselves, where, in some mild forms of the disease, nature
effected a cure by copious perspiration, encouraged by warm drinks and extra
clothing.</p>

<p>The undersigned, with one accord, have found purgatives injurious, if used
before perspiration or blood-letting had been resorted to, to allay the irritable
state of the stomach and bowels; and then only the milder purgatives should
be employed, such as calomel or blue pills, guarded with minute doses of opium,
and carried off, after a few hours, with rhubarb, combined with soda and carbonate
of ammonia.</p>

Hospital.</p>

<h2><i>Origin of the Cholera at Sunderland.</i> By <span class="smcap">T. M. Greenhow</span>, Esq.
of Newcastle.</h2>

<p>The assumed capability of Cholera being conveyed by shipping from one
country to another, on which our system of quarantine is founded, very naturally
gave rise to the suspicion, when it first appeared in the port of Sunderland,
of its having been imported from some place on the Continent, where it
was known to prevail; and several stories were in circulation descriptive of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
manner in which it had thus been introduced. I shall not here repeat any of
these tales, suffice it to say that none of them have been in any degree authenticated.
That the ships which were blamed for having committed the mischief,
were found to have been from uninfected ports, their bills of health clean, and
their crews healthy; in point of fact they were fairly acquitted of the charge;
and I believe the conviction is now almost universally entertained by the inhabitants
of Sunderland, medical and non-medical, that the disease did not reach
that place from any foreign source whatever. It may be further stated that the
first case of cholera which took place in this part of the country, was at a considerable
distance from Sunderland, having been at a small village called Team,
about two miles south-west of Newcastle. This case occurred to Dr. Alexander,
of Newcastle, on the 4th of August, 1831. The details are given in the Appendix,
No. I.; other cases occurred at Newcastle simultaneously, if not before
the regular appearance of the disease at Sunderland; although want of experience
of its true characteristics, and unwillingness to believe in the fact, induced
medical gentlemen to endeavour to prove that these were not cases of the new
disease; yet subsequent observation has sufficiently proved their identity, and,
I believe, it is now generally admitted. Such were the cases of Oswald Reay,
which occurred in October, of William Armstrong in the beginning, and of
Robert Jordan towards the end of November. On the 7th December the next
case occurred, that of Maria Mills, with which commenced the official reports
of the Board of Health of this place. The strictest inquiries respecting the
origin of these cases have failed to obtain the slightest evidence of their having
arisen from any infected source, and seem to prove, in the most satisfactory
manner, that, however the disease may have since extended itself, its commencement
in the country was spontaneous, upon whatever causes it may have
depended.</p>

<h2><i>On Asiatic Cholera Morbus</i>. By <span class="smcap">Paul M. Eve</span>, M. D. of Augusta,
<i>Georgia</i>.</h2>

<p>Believing it criminal to withhold from the medical profession anything on the
Cholera Morbus at this moment, and conceiving it a duty to comply with the
request of the editor of the American Journal of the Medical Sciences, I send
the following observations which were made last summer while I was in Europe.
I had felt a reluctance to make a further communication to the public on this
engrossing subject, which was warranted and justified from my late situation
in the Polish army; my time and attention having been almost exclusively devoted
to surgical cases, and opportunities of investigating this disease having
been comparatively limited. If it is thought, however, that my observations,
imperfect as they are, and that my opinion, humble as it is, can in any way
serve my fellow-labourers in the treatment of this modern plague, I most willingly
and cheerfully present them my views on the subject.</p>

<p>As I have neither time nor inclination to write a long article, I will briefly
state the principal symptoms of the Asiatic Cholera Morbus, the appearances
on dissection, and then deduce from them the treatment. An attack is usually
preceded by diarrhœa or by uneasiness in the stomach and bowels for some
days, or is suddenly announced by vomiting and purging, commencing about
three o’clock in the morning, when the temperature is lowest of the twenty-four
hours; and is followed and accompanied by cramps or spasmodic contractions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
of the abdomen. There is great prostration of the animal powers; shrinking
of the external parts, particularly of the features, which assume in many
places as well as the fingers and toes, a leaden or purple appearance; a cold and
moist or even a wet skin, conveying when felt, the sensation of touching a frog;
great thirst; the tongue is blue and cold, or moist and partly covered with a
white fur; the pulse is either imperceptible at the wrist or is quick, frequent,
feeble and intermitting; respiration is slow and very difficult; the voice is much
altered, questions and answers being made in a low whisper; the secretions,
particularly of the kidneys, are diminished, except into the alimentary canal,
where they are altered and augmented, without however any bile; purging and
vomiting, sometimes one only, but generally both; first the contents of the stomach
and intestines are discharged, and then a peculiar whitish fluid resembling
rice-gruel or sero-albuminous matter; and lastly, cramps of the extremities,
most frequently of the legs, and which may be compared to a bayonet piercing
the calf or most muscular part.</p>

<p>The appearances after death, were almost constantly the same. The external
parts were very much diminished in size; the extremities, the nose, lips, eyelids,
cheeks, &amp;c. were of a bluish or livid colour, and the skin was wrinkled
upon the hands and feet. The vessels of the brain in some subjects contained
black blood, but generally there was nothing peculiar in the contents of the
cranium. There was more blood in the spine, probably arising from position.
The heart, lungs and large vessels were filled with a fluid resembling tar in colour
and consistency. Two hours after death it was liquid and appeared like
venous blood; but at twenty-four hours it seemed deprived of serosity and of
the property of coagulation, and albuminous concretions were found in the
heart. The stomach and intestines were either empty or contained matter similar
to the vomitings and purgings; their coats were contracted and paler than
in a natural state, or as was most frequently the case, presented all the varieties
from congestion to sub-inflammation. The liver and vena portæ were distended
with black blood, and the gall-bladder with tenacious, dark yellow, or green
bile. In almost every case the bladder was found empty and contracted.</p>

<p>From the above symptoms and results of post mortem examinations, it would
seem that the pathology of the cholera morbus may be explained by a want of
oxegenation of the blood, which becoming surcharged with carbon is unfit to
stimulate the heart to contraction, and hence the congestion upon the internal
and vital organs at the expense of the surface and extremities. With this pathological
view of the disease, and from the positive fact of there being a centripetal
action of the blood, is easily deduced the principle of conducting its
treatment&mdash;the equilibrium of the circulation must be restored or death will
ensue. Now, mechanically speaking, there are two ways of affecting this object,
either by introducing a power which will give the blood a centrifugal
direction, or calling it back to the surface, by direct external applications. But
the animal economy is governed by other as well as mechanical laws; the vital
properties of the heart are oppressed, its energy is diminished, and its power
of reäction impaired by an accumulation of blood, and this is peculiarly the
case when the blood is black or not oxegenated; the stimuli or powers introduced
to rouse its action would therefore be worse than useless; besides, we
usually address the heart through the stomach, which is in such an irritable
state as to reject even the mildest article. Upon the surface, on the contrary,
there is a want of action, and stimuli are called for to excite the skin; to restore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
its lost or increase its feeble circulation, and thus draw the blood and heat from
the internal parts of the extremities.</p>

<p>The plan of treatment which I have found most successful, consisted in varying
the following means according to circumstances. Within the first four hours
after an attack, bleeding will generally be necessary; but when prostration has
ensued and when the surface is covered with cold sweat, leeches to the epigastric
region, or cupping followed by warm fomentations or mustard plaster or
blister, together with frictions and heat to the extremities, will afford the
greatest and most speedy relief. Notwithstanding the various and multiplied
articles of the materia medica which have been recommended, as opium, calomel,
oxide of bismuth, cajuput oil, spirits, &amp;c. to allay vomiting and purging
and calm spasms, I must give my decided preference to dermoid applications,
which invite the blood from the heart, lungs, liver, stomach, &amp;c. the congestion
of which produces these symptoms. I do not deny that there are cases which
can be, and are relieved by medicines; but, since we possess no remedy which
can drive the blood from the centre to the surface&mdash;since all internal medicines
are apt to excite vomiting, one of the most painful, distressing and fatal symptoms
of cholera&mdash;and moreover, since we possess means which can be easily
managed and varied to suit circumstances, and whose action is plain and evident
to the senses&mdash;I cannot forsake them to launch upon the sea of experiment
and conjecture, in the treatment of this rapid disease. The language of those
who advocate the administration of internal remedies, is to give so much of a
mixture or so many pills, and if they produce <i>vomiting</i>, repeat the dose; but if
a cure is to be effected by relieving the symptoms, why give those medicines
which excite or aggravate them? An infusion of peppermint, or the oil or essence
of this plant, with a few drops of laudanum, in a little warm brandy and
water, is what I have found best adapted for internal use; and even this should
be prohibited when it produces vomiting. This symptom is often so distressing
and so easily excited, that the stomach will reject whatever is presented to it.
In such cases, I rely upon the horizontal position, perfect rest, and heat and
frictions to the abdomen and extremities, without administering any thing internally.
The warm bath I have known to be of great service, but the time
necessary to prepare it and the exposure of the body to the air, are serious objections
to its general employment. The same will not hold good in relation to the
vapour bath, where the patient can be kept continually warm. Excessive thirst
is best relieved by cold gum water, or by a piece of ice dissolved in the mouth.</p>

<p>Having enjoyed an opportunity of comparing the practice of the English,
French, German and Poles, while stationed at Warsaw, in the months of May,
June, July, and August, of the past year, and having experienced personally
the disease, I feel some confidence in recommending the above treatment of
the Cholera, to the American practitioner of medicine: and in support of its
correctness and superiority, I will state that at Wisnia, a town of Gallacia, out
of two hundred and forty persons attacked with it who were subjected to cutaneous
frictions, and to the internal use of only an infusion of chamomile and
peppermint <i>two alone died</i>.</p>

<p>To prevent an attack of cholera, cleanliness and sobriety ought to be most
rigidly observed. All sudden or great impressions upon the system, as changes
in the temperature of the air, cold and moisture, or emotions of the mind, excessive
joy, fear, and the depressing passions, should be carefully avoided. The
body to be kept moderately warm, a belt of flannel is recommended to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
worn; and the mind calm, and confiding in a protecting Providence. The diet
should be regular, and without any material change in the accustomed repasts.
Emetics and purgatives are to be avoided, and certain articles of nourishment
which are known to predispose to colic, or cholera affections; these are bad
beer, sour-crout, cabbage, salad, beans or peas, spinage, cucumbers, pickles,
unripe sour fruit, musk and water melons, cold meats, sour milk, &amp;c. Good
soups, beef, mutton, veal, fowls, eggs, Irish potatoes, bread, and tea in preference
to coffee, should constitute the principal food of those who inhabit an infected
district.</p>

<p>After all that has happened to admonish us, we can still hope that the cholera
may not reach the Southern States. Its general course has been north-westwardly;
from Calcutta it reached the Russian Empire; from Constantinople
it passed to Great Britain. Although it existed in Hungary and in Vienna, still
Lombardy, Switzerland, and Italy, have escaped; and the same thing is applicable
to France and Paris, in relation to Spain and Portugal. It has not even
existed in cities of the South of France, and Quebec and Montreal are nearly
in the latitude of Paris; besides, these two Canadian cities are remarkable as
being the most filthy and ill-ventilated of America. If it has progressed in a
north-westwardly direction, and if it has avoided a southern latitude in Europe,
why may we not escape its dreadful ravages? Let us, however, be prepared
to meet it, that if it ever does come, we may be ready to cure the distressed,
to relieve the afflicted, and to lessen the sufferings of the dying victim.</p>

<h2><i>Non-Purgative Salts in Cholera.</i></h2>

<p>The following statement, relative to the treatment of cholera in
the prison at Cold Bath Fields, are interesting, and are said by the
editor of the London Medical Gazette, to be entitled to entire confidence
as to its accuracy.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“The first twelve cases occurred in the vagrant’s ward, and the patients were
attacked soon after some prisoners had been admitted from St. Giles’s, and other
infected districts. The first case that was reported as cholera, occurred on the
5th of April. This man was suddenly attacked, and died after a very short illness
with all the symptoms of the prevailing epidemic.</p>

<p>“When the first cases occurred, there were in all about twelve hundred
persons in the prison; but, up to the beginning of this month, they were not
afflicted with bowel complaints, nor, in fact, with any other epidemic disease,
being as healthy as they generally are at that season of the year.</p>

<p>“The first four cases were treated in the common way, with brandy and
opium, an ammoniated mixture, ginger, sinapisms to the region of the stomach,
the hot air-bath, &amp;c. &amp;c.; and all of them died after a short illness.</p>

<p>“Since the 4th of April, up to this date, (April 17,) forty cases in all have
been under treatment. Of this number, nineteen were admitted into the Observation
ward with the premonitory symptoms of cholera. All of these had
bowel complaints and suspicious ejections; some of them complained of severe
pain in the abdomen, sickness of the stomach, and in several cases these symptoms<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
were attended with cramps, chiefly in the lower extremities. The whole
of them were immediately treated by Mr. Wakefield with non-purgative saline
remedies, recommended by Dr. Stevens, and in general they were convalescent
in one, two, or three days, from the commencement of this practice. From
this we may infer, that where the disease is attended to early, and <i>properly
treated</i>, the state of collapse may be prevented in nineteen cases out of twenty.</p>

<p>“We must state, however, that as the numbers increased, it became necessary
to dismiss those that appeared to be least ill, on purpose to make room for
others. Of those that were dismissed as convalescent, two were reädmitted
soon after in a state of collapse, and though every attempt was made to save
them, yet they both died after a very short illness, with the symptoms of cholera
in its most virulent form. With the exception, however, of the two that
died, none of the cases, (seventeen in number,) were reported to the Central
Board, partly, we believe, from a wish to avoid spreading alarm with respect
to the prison, and partly because the disease was checked in the beginning;
consequently, the patients had not <i>all</i> the symptoms of cholera, such as occur
in the worst cases, or in the last stage.</p>

<p>“In addition to the above seventeen which were not reported, there were
twenty-one cases where the symptoms of cholera were very distinctly marked.
Of this number, four of the early cases were treated in the common way, with
diffusible stimuli, &amp;c. &amp;c., and all of them died after a short illness. These,
with the two cases of relapse from the Observation ward, make in all six deaths.
Mr. Wakefield, however, having lost all faith in the common treatment, changed
the practice:&mdash;at the request of Dr. Stevens, the other fifteen cases were put
under the saline treatment, and all of them recovered.</p>

<p>“When the patients were first admitted, the following powder was immediately
given, either in half a tumbler of tepid water, or occasionally in a little
thin, clear, beef-tea:&mdash;</p>

<p>“Supercarbonate of Soda, ℨss. Muriate of Soda, ℈j. Chlorate of Potass, grs.
vii.</p>

<p>“The above was given every hour, and continued until the patients were
recovering from the state of collapse; after which it was diminished in frequency,
in proportion as the reäction increased.</p>

<p>“In all these cases, the outline of the practice was nearly the same; but in
several instances the treatment was varied according to circumstances. When
the stomach, for example, was extremely irritable, it was found that the carbonate
of soda, given by itself, or the tartrate of soda, in a state of effervescence,
were the most effective remedies that could be used on purpose to allay the
irritation, so as to enable the stomach to retain the stronger salts.</p>

<p>“During the progress of the disease, an enema, with a large table-spoonful
of muriate of soda, dissolved in warm water, was administered with or without
sugar, starch, &amp;c. every three or four hours, at as high a temperature as the
patients could well bear it. Sinapisms were also applied as early as possible to
the region of the stomach, betwixt the shoulders, &amp;c.; and in the cold stage,
frictions were also frequently used with warm towels. Of the seventeen cases
that were treated in this way, two died, (namely, the two patients who were
reädmitted in a state of complete collapse,) making in seventeen cases, two
deaths, and fifteen recoveries. But including the whole of those that were
under the saline treatment, the total amount is, in thirty-six cases, two deaths,
and thirty-four recoveries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span></p>

<p>“The cases in question were under the care of Mr. Wakefield, the medical
attendant of the establishment, and during his absence they were attended to
by Mr. J. Wm. Crooke, who kept notes of the cases, and saw that the medicines
were properly administered. We may add, also, that Mr. Wakefield, with
a degree of fairness which does him great credit, invited Dr. Stevens to attend
along with him to witness the effect of the saline treatment, which has here, we
may say, for the first time, been fairly tried in this disease.</p>

<p>“We can also state, that the cholera made its appearance about the same
period amongst a small colony of Italians, who live in a narrow lane within a
few hundred yards of the prison. Of these, eleven were attacked. The three
first cases were treated by bleeding, brandy, and opium, all used at the same
time, and they all died. The other eight cases were attended by Mr. Whitmore,
a surgeon in the neighbourhood, who, having witnessed the effects of
the saline treatment in the prison, adopted it. All his patients speedily and
completely recovered, except one, who, on the 13th, was so ill that he was not
expected to live many hours; even he, however, is now in a state of convalescence.
<i>Thus there have been in all fifty-three cases, seven of which were treated
in the common way, with diffusible stimuli; and out of this number seven died;
while, of the forty-six that were under the saline treatment, there were two deaths
and forty-four recoveries.</i>”</p>

<h2><i>Health of Philadelphia.</i></h2>

<p>The epidemic whose approach we confidently announced a month
since, is now prevailing among us, and appears as yet scarcely to
have attained its maximum. The public mind having been prepared
to expect its visitation, and quieted, to a considerable extent, by the
preparations made for its reception, there has been little excitement,
and certainly none of that panic which has elsewhere been so favourable
to its ravages.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
